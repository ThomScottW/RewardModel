"""Complete this Biblical quotation: """"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than...""","The full quotation is:  ""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.""  It is found in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In each case, it is spoken by Jesus in response to a question about what a person must do to inherit eternal life. In Matthew 19, a young man asks Jesus how he can inherit eternal life. Jesus tells him to keep the commandments, but the young man says that he has already done that. Jesus then tells him to sell all of his possessions and give the money to the poor, and to follow him. The young man is unable to do this, and he goes away sad.  In Mark 10, the same story is told, but the young man is identified as a ruler. In Luke 18, the story is slightly different. In this version, Jesus tells a parable about a rich man who is unable to enter the kingdom of God because he is unwilling to give up his wealth.  The meaning of this quotation is debated by scholars. Some believe that Jesus was literally saying that it is impossible for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. Others believe that Jesus was using hyperbole to emphasize the difficulty of a rich person entering the kingdom of God. Still others believe that Jesus was speaking about the importance of detachment from material possessions.  Regardless of the meaning, this quotation is a reminder that wealth can be a barrier to spiritual growth. It is important to remember that true riches are found in God, not in material possessions.",1

"In Lewis Carroll's poem The Hunting of the Snark, what did the elusive, troublesome snark turn into to fool hunters?"," In Lewis Carroll's poem The Hunting of the Snark, the elusive, troublesome snark turns into ""a grin without a cat"" to fool the hunters. The poem is a nonsense poem, so it is not clear what the snark actually is or what it does. However, the grin without a cat is a clever way for the snark to evade capture.

Belshazzar was a pagan king who had no fear of God. He held a great feast in his palace, where he and his guests drank wine from the sacred vessels that had been taken from the temple in Jerusalem. Suddenly, a hand appeared and wrote on the wall in Aramaic: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.  Belshazzar was terrified, and he called for his wise men to interpret the writing. But none of them could.

TEKEL means ""You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting."" PERES means ""Your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.""

What would Kevin Scale have been called if it had adopted the originator's first name?," The Kelvin scale was named after William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, a Scottish mathematical physicist and engineer. If it had adopted the originator's first name, it would have been called the Kevin scale. However, the Kelvin scale is the most widely used temperature scale in science and engineering, and it is unlikely that it would have been renamed after its originator.  The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale, which means that it is based on the concept of absolute zero. Absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular motion ceases, and it is defined as being equal to -273.15 degrees Celsius. The Kelvin scale is used in scientific and engineering applications because it is more precise than other temperature scales, such as the Celsius scale.  The Kelvin scale is also used in everyday life, but it is not as common as the Celsius scale. For example, the color temperature of light bulbs is often expressed in Kelvins. Color temperature is a measure of how warm or cool a light appears, and it is measured on a scale from 1,000 to 10,000 Kelvins. A light bulb with a color temperature of 3,000 Kelvins will appear warm and yellow, while a light bulb with a color temperature of 6,000 Kelvins will appear cool and blue.",0

She was married to Petter Lindstrom, a Swedish dentist, and they had a daughter, Pia. In 1948, Bergman began an affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini, and she gave birth to their son, Roberto, in 1949. Bergman's actions were seen as a betrayal of traditional American values, and she was subjected to a great deal of public scrutiny and criticism. In 1950, the US Senate called her a ""powerful force of evil"" and accused her of being a ""threat to the American way of life."" Bergman was blacklisted by Hollywood, and she was unable to find work for several years. She eventually returned to Hollywood, and she went on to win three Academy Awards.

What did the Lone Ranger's title Kemo Sabe mean in Apache?,"The meaning of the word ""Kemosabe"" has been debated for years. Some people believe it means ""trusty scout"" or ""faithful friend"" in Apache, while others believe it means ""white shirt"" or even ""stupid white man.""  The most likely explanation is that ""Kemosabe"" is a made-up word. The Lone Ranger radio show premiered in 1933, and the word ""Kemosabe"" was never used in any Native American languages before that time. It is possible that the show's creators simply made up the word to sound Native American.  Regardless of its meaning, ""Kemosabe"" has become synonymous with the Lone Ranger. It is a reminder of the close friendship between the Lone Ranger and Tonto, and it is a symbol of justice and law in the Old West.  Here are some other possible meanings of ""Kemosabe"":  In the Ojibwe language, ""gimooshaabi"" means ""he/she looks out in secret."" In the Potawatomi language, ""gimoozhaabi"" means ""he/she looks out for others."" In the Tewa language, ""Apache"" means ""friend"" and ""Sabe"" means ""trusty."" It is possible that the word ""Kemosabe"" is a combination of words from different Native American languages.",0
